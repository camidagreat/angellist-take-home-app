Prompt
~~~~~~

Suppose we discover a bug with our algorithm and investors for two deals had incorrect
allocations. This means that some of the investors ended up investing more than they were allowed to
while others invested less than they were allowed to. One of deals happened two years ago and the
other one happened two weeks ago. Please describe, in detail, how would you go about correcting this
issue and how would you communicate this to the affected customers.

Response
~~~~~~~~

I would first make sure to apologize with the force of 100 CSMs.
Then I would make sure to track down the bug that caused the error
and correct it. Then, depending on the valuation change of the companies
that got the investments and other business changes, I assume we would
need to reconcile any wrongly appreciated/depreciated investments to
the value they would have been with the correct investment amounts.
The mess-up from two weeks ago would go through the same process but
is much less likely to need a lot of financial reparations.
