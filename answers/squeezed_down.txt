An angry investor sent us a note about how they keep getting squeezed down to $25K per deal even
though their requested amount is $100K. Underneath the hood, this was because there's limited
allocation (low supply) and a high volume of investors looking to invest (high demand). How should
we communicate this to an investor in a way that minimizes the damage to our relationship with
the investor?

In addition, can you think of a better way we could change the proration basis logic so that
this could potentially happen less often?

"We very much appreciate your business and are very sorry for any confusion our pro rata
allocation is causing. We are very diligent about tracking a historical record of investments
made by each investor. This informs the limits we enforce on how much each person can invest.
The investment you're referring to saw an incredible amount of interest with a lot of investors
that typically invest between XXXX and XXXXX. Base on the interest we saw, we had to squeeze
all investors down from what they were hoping to invest. We will be sure to be transparent
about this process in the future."

Without changing supply/demand, there isn't a whole lot to be done. You could only allow
investors to see certain deals based on perceived interest. That feels a bit slimy though.
Having a historical record of investments made (kind of like a book of credit) could help
inform who should be allowed to invest and how much they can invest.
